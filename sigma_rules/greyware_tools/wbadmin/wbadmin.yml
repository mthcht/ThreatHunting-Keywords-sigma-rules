status: experimental
description:
- '''Wbadmin allows administrators to manage and automate backup and recovery operations
  in Windows systems. Adversaries may abuse wbadmin to manipulate backups and restore
  points as part of their evasion tactics. This can include deleting backup files.
  disabling backup tasks. or tampering with backup configurations to hinder recovery
  efforts and potentially erase traces of their malicious activities. By interfering
  with backups. adversaries can make it more challenging for defenders to restore
  systems and detect their presence.'''
