SigPloit aims to cover all used protocols used in the operators interconnects SS7. GTP (3G). Diameter (4G) or even SIP for IMS and VoLTE infrastructures used in the access layer and SS7 message encapsulation into SIP-T. Recommendations for each vulnerability will be provided to guide the tester and the operator the steps that should be done to enhance their security posture",
