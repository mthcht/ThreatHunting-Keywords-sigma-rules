Sample PHP code is provided in /examplesitecode. The sample code will take a username and password from a HTTP POST request and transmit it to the phishing script.  The phishing script listens on a local port and awaits a packet of credentials. Once credentials are received. the phishing script will open a new web browser instance and navigate to the desired URL (the actual site where you will be entering a users credentials). Credentials will be submitted by the web browser",
