        "description": "Fluxion is a security auditing and social-engineering research tool. It is a remake of linset by vk496 with (hopefully) fewer bugs and more functionality. The script attempts to retrieve the WPA/WPA2 key from a target access point by means of a social engineering (phishing) attack. Its compatible with the latest release of Kali (rolling). Fluxions attacks' setup is mostly manual. but experimental auto-mode handles some of the attacks' setup parameters. Read the FAQ before requesting issues",
