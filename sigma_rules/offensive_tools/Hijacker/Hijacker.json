        "description": "Hijacker is a Graphical User Interface for the penetration testing tools Aircrack-ng. Airodump-ng. MDK3 and Reaver. It offers a simple and easy UI to use these tools without typing commands in a console and copy&pasting MAC addresses.This application requires an ARM android device with an internal wireless adapter that supports Monitor Mode. A few android devices do. but none of them natively. This means that you will need a custom firmware. Any device that uses the BCM4339 chipset (MSM8974. such as Nexus 5. Xperia Z1/Z2. LG G2. LG G Flex. Samsung Galaxy Note 3) will work with Nexmon (which also supports some other chipsets). Devices that use BCM4330 can use bcmon.",
