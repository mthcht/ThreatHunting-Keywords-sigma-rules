# ThreatHunting-Keywords-sigma-rules

Low quality sigma detections rules for hunting with Threat Hunting keywords from [ThreatHunting-Keywords](https://github.com/mthcht/ThreatHunting-Keywords)

You have the flexibility to regenerate all the rules using your own fields. This can be achieved by adjusting the field variables found in the script located here: https://github.com/mthcht/ThreatHunting-Keywords-sigma-rules/blob/main/_utils/create_sigma_rules.py

*Developed as an alternative solution for specific XDR/SIEM systems that exclusively operate with Sigma files, circumventing the limitations of not being able to use lookup tables*
